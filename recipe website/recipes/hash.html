                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dice 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes into ½-inch cubes. Place in a medium saucepan, add ½ teaspoon of the kosher salt, and cover with cool water by at least 1 inch. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat as needed and simmer until just tender, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain the potatoes. Transfer to a baking sheet and spread out into a single layer to air dry. Meanwhile, dice 1 small yellow onion (about 1 cup). Dice 1 small red bell pepper (about 1 cup). Finely mince 4 garlic cloves (about 1 heaping tablespoon). Coarsely chop fresh parsley leaves until you have ½ cup. Finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about ½ cup), plus more for serving.</li>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the potatoes and season with the remaining ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes, onion, and bell pepper are browned in spots, about 5 minutes. (This will depend on the size of your skillet. If the vegetables aren’t browning after a few minutes, increase the heat to high.) Add the garlic and stir until fragrant and light golden-brown, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the parsley, Parmesan, and ½ teaspoon sweet paprika, and stir to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed. Sprinkle with more Parmesan before serving.</li>
